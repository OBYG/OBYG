Before we begin our project, we have to explain what subject and dataset are selected. We are going to explore "house structure dataset". 
If you want to choose your house to stay, what factors are you going to consider? Just in case of Korea, people consider many complex factors.
For example, Parents want to move their house near school which is good for their children to get better education.
And, some people consider the location which is near the subway station. It will be easy to take public transportation.
Like above examples, there are a lot of factors we have to consider to select our house.
But, if we set aside the price and accessability of residence, basic factors such as whether the house is well-lighted are to be the main things we should take into account when choosing a house to live in.
Everyone agrees that low-cost residence like a rooftop or semi-basement house contains the worst conditions in that it's hot in summer and cold in winter.
The basic and fundamental function of residence is 'Heating Load and Cooling Load(Energy Efficiency)'. 
We are going to analyze the house structure dataset which can reveal some valuable information to us.
The goal of this 2-weeks project is to find out which factor is the most influential to heating and cooling load. Through this group project, 
we will be able to adapt the result when choosing our own residence in real life.
